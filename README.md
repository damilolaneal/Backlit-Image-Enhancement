# Improving-the-Visibility-of-Backlit-Images
Okay, so here's what you have to do to replicate the results:

1- Download Spyder through Anaconda (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/integration/spyder/). <br />
2- Then download the code as a zipped folder. <br />
3- Unzip the folder to wherever directory you prefer (please, don't install it on the desktop folder). <br />
4- Add the folder to Spyder as a project. <br />
5- Run the function main.py. <br />
   To make sure it run flawlessley, open the function in spyder. Hit the F5 key to run the function in the interpeter. Then in the interpeter, run:<br />
   main() <br />
6- After that, run quatitativeResults.m in MATLAB to view the quantitative results. <br />.

I hope that is clear :)
