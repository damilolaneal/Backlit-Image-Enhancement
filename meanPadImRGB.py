def meanPadImRGB(Im, f):
    # Pads the image with mean value to retain its dimensions when filtered using "f".
    import numpy as np
    fr = f.shape[0]  #Number of rows in the filter
    fc = f.shape[1]  #Number of columns in the filter
    x = int(np.floor(fr/2))  #Offset in the x-axis
    y = int(np.floor(fc/2))  #Offset in the y-axis
    u = np.sum(Im)/np.size(Im)  #Mean value of the image
    
    # Padding the image depends on the dimensions of the filter, or rather, whether
    # they are even or not. So you could have:
        # fr: odd,   fc: odd
        # fr: odd,   fc: even
        # fr: even,   fc: odd
        # fr: even,   fc: even
    # Each of these condition requires its own equation for finding the padded
    # image. Such conditions can be accounted for using if statements. However,
    # running if statement slows the code down, and accounting for all conditions
    # does not seem to be necessary since filters almost always have odd dimensions.
    # The solution to this is to use "exception handling". This allows the code to
    # assume the filter is odd and run its associated equation, and only check the
    # conditions if an error is raised. Thus, we keep the speed while accounting
    # for all different conditions.
